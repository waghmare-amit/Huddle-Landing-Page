## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working on this project, I learnt some new things and also was able to properly use the CSS properties for different usecases (and also learnt their purposes).

I polished my knowledge on margin, padding, difference between px and rem (by default, 1rem = 16px). rem is a responsive unit, it is preferred to use while making a responsive page, we can play with the rem value by adjusting it's default value which would help reduce the workload while making the page responsive.

The new things which I learned were making the page responsive. To do so - we have to use "@media" which is a CSS at-rule used for defining the page style for different screen sizes.

### Continued development

I would polishing my knowledge on making pages responsive with the future projects. Also I have to learn the purpose and usecase of many CSS properties.
